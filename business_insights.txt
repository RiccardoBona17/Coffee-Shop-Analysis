## BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM THE ANALYSIS OF COFFEE SHOP DATASET

**Analysis by month:** it seems like during the first half of the semester (period January - March) the revenue was significantly lower than in the other months. Interestingly, the trend is present in all the stores. A solution to this underperformance during the first three months might be to conduct advertising campaigns to encourage customers to come to the stores and consume our products.

**Analysis by day of the week:** it looks like the number of transactions remains stable over the week, except on Saturday where it drops significantly. The decrease of transaction on Saturday might be accounted by less number of people that commute to work, but this hypothesis doesn’t seem to hold when we compare it with Sunday, which is holiday too. A good way to attract more customers on Saturdays might entail creating a set of promotions that are available only on Saturdays.

**Analysis by hour (6-20]:** it seems that the majority of transactions happen in the early opening hours (7 - 10), when people commute to work. The rest of the opening hours still manage to reach an acceptable number of purchases. However, when stores are open within the timeframes from 6-7 AM and 8-9 PM, the transactions remain pretty low, which indicates that we might be better off by changing the operating hours. As a proof of concept, the only store that stays open from 7 AM - 7 PM still manages to make a comparable number of transactions with respect to the other stores. 

**Analysis by product category:** the product category with the highest number of transactions across the three stores is *coffee.* The second is tea, and the third bakery, which might tell us that people come to our stores mainly to eat breakfast. At the bottom of the list there are categories of items deemed “sophisticated”, for example coffee beans, packaged chocolate, and others. A way to increment the number of transactions related to this products “niche”, we could create special deals that bind together highly consumed with sophisticated items. This might encourage customers to (at least) try new items out.

**Analysis by product type:** this analysis goes deeper into the insights given by the previous. It seems that the top 15 items in terms of number of transactions are mostly beverages, like coffee, tea, drinking chocolate, and others. This really seems to be the driving factor of most sales in our stores.
