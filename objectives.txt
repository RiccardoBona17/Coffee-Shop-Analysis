# CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

You've recently become a franchise owner at Maven Rosters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City.

To better understand purchase behaviour and streamline operations, you've collected transactional data from January - June 2023 (dataset can be found here: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?pageSize=10).

YOUR GOAL is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

Objectives:

1) Profile and prepare raw data for analysis 

2) Explore the data with Excel Pivot tables

3) Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends in the data
