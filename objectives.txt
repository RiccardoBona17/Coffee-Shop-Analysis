# CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT

You've recently become a franchise owner at Maven Rosters, a coffee shop chain with three locations in New York City.

Objectives:

1) Profile and prepare raw data for analysis 

2) Explore the data with Excel Pivot tables

3) Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends in the data
