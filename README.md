To better understand purchase behaviour and streamline operations, you've collected transactional data from January - June 2023 (dataset kindly provided by https://mavenanalytics.io/).

**YOUR GOAL** is to transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.

## Objectives:

1) Profile and prepare raw data for analysis 

2) Explore the data with Excel Pivot tables

3) Build a dynamic dashboard to visualize patterns and trends in the data
